        Around the same time as the terror group classification hit the Swedish
        Nazi merchandise business, a man appeared in casual summer clothing at a
        post office in Alingsås earlier in August 2024. He was wearing shorts,
        sandals, sunglasses and a t-shirt paying tribute to the German Nazis
        killed during World War II. With the text “Revolution” and an image of
        soldiers in SS uniform emblazened across the back of his t-shirt, and
        with a picture of German white power band Blutzeugen (Blood witnesses,
        Nazi Germany's term for the martyrs of its own movement) and the text
        "Der Kampf geht weiter" (The struggle goes on) printed on the front, he
        left the post office with new deliveries arriving for his company.

        The man in the t-shirt was Martin Flennfors, 38. He is the owner and CEO
        of the Nazi online store Midgård, which, despite strong ties to the
        terrorist-classified NMR, has continued to operate by selling its
        propaganda internationally.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        In December of 2023, information on approximately 20,000 purchases was
        put online. The leak, which was spread by the left-wing extremist
        organization AFA (Antifascistisk Aktion), contained Midgård's customer
        register between the years 2017 and 2022 — and provided insight into
        just how widespread Midgård's sales are.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        In the database, it is possible to see in detail who ordered what and
        when. Among the approximately 2,500 unique customers who have placed a
        total of over 7,000 orders, there are several well-known Nazis who are
        themselves Swedish or have ties to Sweden. These individuals have been
        convicted of, among other things, incitement against ethnic groups,
        arson, and politically motivated acts of violence. The leak shows that
        Midgård, which describes itself as "one of the world's largest shops for
        alternative people," has thousands of customers in 62 countries. After
        Sweden, Germany, with roughly 3,400 orders, is the most common recipient
        country. In several of the recipient countries, including Germany,
        Midgård's operations had been completely or partially prohibited.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Midgård's product line connects it to multiple Nazi organizations. In
        addition to magazines from NMR, and its predecessor SMR, Midgård also
        sells newspapers from the defunct Swedes' Party and from the far-right
        organization Det fria Sweden. Midgård is also a retailer of several
        international brands, such as the Polish "Keep it White" clothing brand.
        Midgård's international network has also connected it to several other
        stores and producers of white power products. On several occasions,
        Midgård, on its Telegram channel, has urged followers to also support
        record companies and retailers in, for example, the United States,
        Russia, Serbia and Hungary. Among these are the Russian Übermensch shop
        and the American Hammer shop.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        This summer, the US Hatewatch initiative, which is run by the Southern
        Poverty Law Center, published a review of the approximately 1,500
        purchases that were sent to the United States from Midgård. Among
        Midgård's American clients are representatives of Nazi and radical right
        groups such as Volksfront, Patriot Front, Clockwork Crew and the
        Traditionalist Worker Party. In neighboring Canada, orders have gone to
        activists for Nazi groups such as Vinland Hammerskins, Aryan Guard and
        NSC-131.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        This Expressen-led investigation has also examined the customer
        register, focusing on Midgård's branches in Central Eastern Europe.
        VSquare’s partners have uncovered the following:

      <h2>Serving Orbán’s media empire while ordering Nazi music</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        One of the most interesting customers of Nazi merchandise in Hungary
        works at the country's largest government-controlled media empire, which
        publishes pro-Orbán propaganda and is owned by a foundation represented
        by persons close to Prime Minister Viktor Orbán’s ruling Fidesz party.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        This pro-government journalist published a book on the “radical right”
        and has covered nationalistic topics in his articles. For example, in
        the mid-2010s, he published an interview with the leader of Betyársereg
        (Outlaw Army), which was one of Hungary’s most significant far-right
        paramilitary groups at the time. He also reported on a Swedish town
        where Hungarian immigrants formed a peaceful and diligent community,
        contrasting it with Muslim migrants who were portrayed as violent and
        unable to integrate.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        In 2018, several shipments of white power music were sent to this
        journalist’s address. This included music by Frank Rennicke, a German
        neo-Nazi troubadour convicted of multiple hate crimes. This journalist
        also apparently received music by a German band called Faustrecht,
        multiple band members of which were active in the Blood and Honor
        movement (the band itself also regularly performed at Blood and Honor
        events). In Germany, some of their albums have been classified as
        harmful for minors, which means these albums cannot be publicly
        displayed in stores and may only be sold to persons above 18.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        A national security expert interviewed by Atlatszo.hu revealed that, in
        early 2024, the pro-government journalist was approached and interviewed
        by the Hungarian internal security agency, the Constitution Protection
        Office (Alkotmányvédelmi Hivatal). The investigation allegedly took
        place in connection with the leaked Midgård database (as well as in
        relation to clashes between Nazi and Antifa groups in Budapest in 2023,
        when several people, including both Hungarians and foreigners were
        arrested). The expert added that there is a possibility that other
        Midgård customers were also interrogated by the security agency after
        the database leaked.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        According to the leaked data, Hungarian customers mostly bought music
        from Midgård. The Hungarian pro-government journalist customer said,
        “Looking at the list, I see that at least one third of the customers
        were not at all extreme-minded – they were just selling records, spicing
        up their rock-metal-punk selections with exotic, Swedish, Finnish or
        Estonian national rock music. Because they were cheap in the 2010’s, and
        there was a demand – even though no one understood a word of the lyrics.
        I think what people listen to in their homes is a matter of taste, and
        we should not peek into each other's bedrooms or CD players.”
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        The journalist customer also argued that these are “legal CDs” ordered
        legally from a registered music publisher. According to him, if a crime
        were committed, it was by those who hacked into Midgård’s database and
        then, “with a stigmatizing intent,” compiled a searchable list of
        customers with names, addresses and phone numbers. “To list people
        openly, threateningly, on the basis of their supposed political views is
        no longer a matter of taste, and, in fact, to me, this seems to be
        fascism,” the avid customer of Nazi music added.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        In Hungary, possessing, selling or publicly playing music with Nazi or
        far-right lyrics is not automatically considered unlawful. However, if
        there is a trial in which the indictment involves such music, the lyrics
        are examined thoroughly, line by line, before the judgment is delivered.
      </p>
      <br />

      <h2>Czech and Slovak customers range from neo-Nazis to soldiers</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        One of Midgård’s Czech customers was sentenced to four years in prison
        for selling guns without a permit, investigace.cz found. He used to be a
        member of the now-ruling Civic Democratic Party (ODS) but was expelled
        in 2008 when the party found out that he organized a neo-Nazi march.
        Another Czech customer was sentenced for a racially-motivated assault on
        an American-born singer living in the Czech Republic. A third alleged
        Midgård customer was sentenced for attacking a Roma man. Along with
        other offenders, he attacked a group of Romani people: the attackers
        kicked them and shot them with a gas gun, and then stabbed one Romani
        man four times with a knife.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        A lawyer, a businessman in the beauty industry and a tattoo parlor owner
        also shopped online at the Swedish Nazi store.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Reporters from investigace.cz also asked Czech police about the issue of
        selling items with neo-Nazi or skinhead themes. "Usually, these products
        promote movements that suppress rights and freedoms or other crimes that
        fall into the category of hate crimes,“ Colonel Ondřej Moravčík, head of
        the press department, said. According to him, there is no standard
        approach to such sales and they thus must be considered on a
        case-by-case basis. In 2022, an interior ministry spokesman told Czech
        media that law enforcement agencies do not prosecute the use of symbols
        or letters themselves, but rather the specific actions and intent, and
        that the context is always relevant.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        As political scientist Jan Charvát explained to investigace.cz,
        appearance has always been very important to the skinhead subculture.
        “It was exactly the thing that attracted the attention of young boys.
        From the interviews I did with people from this subculture, it clearly
        emerged that they were not attracted to politics in the first place, but
        image and violence were the two key things for becoming a skinhead.
        Politicization often came second.”
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        According to Charvát, there was both a visual and a political dimension
        to being a skinhead — a bald head, heavy boots, bomber jacket, and
        tattoos accompanied racism and anti-semitism. “In order to connect the
        two dimensions and somehow demonstrate them, t-shirts and patches,
        clothes and accessories appeared,“ Charvát explained. Subsequently,
        around the year 2000, a few people in the Czech Republic realized that
        they could profit from selling these items. They organized concerts and
        sold T-shirts and patches or CDs. These shops were also important in
        that they were physical places where members of the subculture could
        meet each other.

      <p>
        Also around 2000, a large number of people from the skinhead subculture
        decided they were no longer comfortable dressing in high boots and
        bombers and were looking for something else, which is what the German
        brand Thor Steinar, and many others, realized they could take advantage
        of” “It offers an aggressive fashion that, if you're a neo-Nazi, you see
        as your own, and if you're not a neo-Nazi, you don't see specific
        symbols in it that can be prosecuted,“ the expert added.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        There were also Czech brands that tried to break through with similar
        fashion around this same time. These companies took advantage of the
        fact that there were people who were eager to buy such clothes because
        it was the main way for them to show their political affiliation. This
        worked until the subculture hollowed out after 2006. "That's when the
        phenomenon of autonomous nationalism emerged, which tried to leave out
        the subcultural dimension," Charvát said, adding that this led to the
        gradual demise of the Czech neo-Nazi subcultural scene, which he says
        disintegrated around 2013.

        The Slovaks identified in the leak also come from a wide range of
        professions and social backgrounds. According to ICJK.sk’s analysis, the
        list of Slovak Midgård customers includes an employee at a Bratislava
        car dealership, the owner of a car rental company, various freelancers
        and contractors from across the country — and even a soldier from the
        Slovak Ministry of Defence. Many on the list allegedly purchased
        neo-Nazi music CDs and other records, and clothing bearing Nazi symbols.
        Notably, according to an unverified list published on a disinformation
        site, the Slovak soldier was involved in nationwide Covid testing
        efforts. He is also reportedly active in a football fan group.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        ICJK.sk contacted the people on the list but most did not respond to the
        inquiries. Those who did reply denied having ordered anything from the
        online Nazi shop.

      <h2>Polish local politicians and activists who love Nazi music</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        FRONTSTORY.PL identified one of Midgård's Polish customers as Olgierd
        Obrycki. He is a close associate of Robert Bąkiewicz, a Polish
        nationalist who was supported by millions of złoty from public funds
        during the previous Law and Justice government. Until recently,
        Bąkiewicz was the organizer of the Warsaw Independence March, one of the
        largest nationalist gatherings in Europe, carried out every year on
        November 11. A few days ago, on September 4, 2024, police raided
        Bąkiewicz’s residence in connection with an investigation into the
        neo-Nazi symbols on display and the hateful slogans aimed at minority
        groups at the Independence March in 2018.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Bąkiewicz associate Obrycki bought records of the Italian band Ultima
        Frontiera from the Swedish store. Ultima Frontiera glorifies a
        neo-fascist from the Avanguardia Nazionale terrorist organization in one
        of their songs. According to FRONTSTORY.PL’s sources with knowledge of
        his activities, Obrycki has been working with Bąkiewicz for over a
        decade. In 2020, he was one of the initiators of the creation of the
        National Guard – an organization of nationalists whose task was to
        "protect Catholic churches" during mass protests against the tightening
        of abortion law in Poland. On his Facebook, Obrycki recommended a book
        by Leon Degrelle, a Belgian fascist who collaborated with the Nazis
        during World War II.

          race" as well as Jews and non-whites. It inspired perpetrators of

        Meanwhile, Michał Wiltosiński, a local activist of the far-right
        Confederation (Konfederacja) party from Jaworzno in Upper Silesia,
        ordered records by the band Gammadion (meaning swastika in Greek). He
        bought a total of 20 records from Midgård. These included some by the
        band Skrewdriver, founded by Ian Stuart Donaldson, who also founded the
        neo-Nazi Blood and Honor international movement. Wiltosiński is not an
        anonymous activist of the Confederation party — as its representative,
        he laid flowers in Jaworzno at a Polish historical monument.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Jerzy Rózio was also a Midgård customer. In the last local elections, he
        ran for councilor of Bielsk Podlaski as a candidate of the right-wing
        alliance. Rózio is not ashamed of his political roots: In his Facebook
        photo, he proudly presents himself with a skinhead tattoo on his left
        forearm. He turned to Midgård to buy, among other things, a belt with a
        buckle "in memory of" Ian Stuart Donaldson. He also ordered records by
        the band Code 291, the lead musician of which is Joakim "Joke" Karlsson,
        a neo-Nazi who until recently had a tattoo of a swastika on his chest
        (he later "painted it over"). In 2018, Karlsson was supposed to be the
        star of the "Ku niepodległej" (“Towards our independent state”) concert,
        organized in Warsaw by the nationalist Niklot Association. The event did
        not take place because – as OKO.press reported at the time — its
        organizers were detained by Polish security services.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        One of Midgård's most frequent customers was Jędrzej Kubski, nicknamed
        Węgorz, a 43-year-old mixed martial arts competitor from Poznań. Kubski
        made his debut twenty years ago and has since won medals in both
        European and Polish jiu-jitsu championships. Articles about his fights
        and interviews from a few years ago can be found online. The database
        shows that he made purchases from the Swedish store nine times between
        2019 and 2021. Among the orders, we find the entire spectrum of the
        neo-Nazi music scene: from Skrewdriver to Code 291 to Pittbulfarm,
        another band by Jaokim "Joke" Karlsson.

      <h2>Europe’s Swedish Nazi merchandise suppliers</h2>
      <br />

      <p>
        In Sweden, Midgård's home country, the most active buyers today are
        middle-aged men who have been active in the Nazi movement since their
        youth in the early 1990s. A resident of Gävle who was a member of the
        now defunct National Socialist Front for several years has, according to
        the customer register, made 111 purchases from 2017 to 2022. A man from
        Skåne with a background in the terrorist-inspired Nazi organization
        White Aryan Resistance and the National Socialist Front ordered 77
        items. In the 1990s, he was found guilty of an arson attack against the
        local editorial office of the newspaper Smålänningen and a police
        station in Älmhult, because, as he explained, "the police work for a
        Zionist regime and newspapers are controlled by Jewish forces.”
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Expressen’s journalists have also examined the hub of this international
        distribution of Nazi goods.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        The tracks lead onto a small dirt road straight into a forest just
        outside central Alingsås. Here, the police raided one of Midgård's two
        warehouses in November 2022 after the chancellor of justice decided to
        open a preliminary investigation into incitement against an ethnic
        group. As police searched through a food cellar and a storage building
        next to the house where Martin Flennfors lives, they also raided an
        apartment on the top floor of a building in central Alingsås belonging
        to Tobias Jonsson, 38. Police photos and a video taken during the raid
        show rows of bookshelves filled with CDs and LPs alongside stacked
        cartons of printed T-shirts and propaganda.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Police found thousands of CDs wrapped in plastic in Flennfor's food
        cellar. In Jonsson's apartment, the Nazi merchandise was stacked in a
        special office and storage area, and also in his kitchen.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Martin Flennfors runs Midgård via a company called Ringhorne AB. Since
        the first half of the 2000s, he has been active in the local Nazi
        movement in Alingsås, first as an active member of the current Nordic
        Resistance Movement's youth organization National Youth, and then moving
        on into its parent organization. He was active there until the mid
        2010s, including as a member of the editorial forum for the
        organization's propaganda website, Nordfront. He was also a regular
        commentator on the site.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        In 2016, Flennfors was also the publisher of Midgård's site. This led to
        his conviction two years later in ten cases of incitement against an
        ethnic group. The offenses concerned products that were for sale on the
        site, including album covers with swastikas and fabric tags with the
        numbers 88, which stands for "Heil Hitler.” (“H” being the eighth letter
        of the alphabet).
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        But Flennfors does not run Midgård alone. Joining him on the company
        board is Martin Engelin, 38, who, since spring 2018, has also been
        registered as a publisher of Midgård's site. Engelin has a long history
        in the Swedish Nazi movement. He is active in the Nordic Resistance
        Movement but was previously involved in the now defunct Nazi party, the
        Swedes' Party. He is a frequent lecturer on subjects such as IT security
        and life as a Nazi activist, and also an author on NMR's websites. When
        he was questioned by police for his role as a publisher of Midgård's
        website in the fall of 2022, Martin Engelin stated that he is also a
        "journalist" on the Nordic Resistance Movement's (NMR) Nordfront
        website.
      </p>
      <br />
      <figure>
        <img

        />
        <figcaption>Martin Engelin. Photo: Swedish police/Expressen</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
        However, NMR is not the only Nazi organization with which Midgård is
        connected. In December 2022, they, together with Nazi group Hammerskin's
        Swedish branch, participated in a demonstration in honor of Swedish Nazi
        leader Birger Furugård. In connection with Furugård's death anniversary,
        unknown representatives of Midgård, together with members of
        Hammerskins, laid a bouquet of flowers on the Nazi leader's grave with
        the words "To the end faithful" printed on the bouquet’s ribbon.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        When NMR was classified as a terrorist group by the US State Department,
        Engelin took to Nordfront to describe the classification as "an
        achievement and a black diploma for our hard, constant and persistent
        work for the new Nordic nation and its inhabitants.”
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        The ties between Midgård and NMR do not stop there. In the summer of
        2015, the Nazi organization collected money to cover Midgård’s legal
        fees after the chancellor of justice opened a preliminary investigation
        against Midgård for incitement against a ethnic group. The person who
        was then the Midgård company's board member – and who was later also
        convicted of four counts of incitement against a ethnic group for album
        covers and a shirt published on Midgård's website – was Tobias Jonsson.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        In the judgment, the district court found that the publication of the
        album cover of the band Vit Aggression's album "Död åt Zog!” (Death to
        Zog!), where a rifle is pointed at the spectator, together with the
        album title's aim at a conspiratorial Jewish world domination,
        constituted "threats and disrespect towards the Jewish ethnic group," as
        well as an incitement to the use of violence. A band shirt of a band
        called Klansmen showed a man in a Ku Klux Klan uniform and a noose with
        the text "fetch the rope," which the court found to be incitement
        against African Americans in its historical context, and an incitement
        to murder.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Jonsson formally left the company's board after the verdict in 2016, but
        he remained close to Midgård even after that. When Expressen asked
        Jonsson about his current role in Midgård, he replied: “I think we keep
        it a little floating, I do a little of what I want to do with Midgård.”
        Otherwise, he didn’t want to answer any questions. “I don't think your
        newspaper is really the one we talk about in, so to speak. We have too
        many differences to get anything out of each other, I think,” he added.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h2>Stormy years and closed investigations</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        The collusion with organized Nazism in Sweden began when Midgård was
        started in the mid-1990s. For several years, sales took place out of a
        physical store in Hisingen, an island in the municipality of Gothenburg.
        Nazi magazines and records with white power bands such as Rahowa and
        Pluton Svea were sold there. The shop became a gathering point for
        skinheads — and a way for the then-growing white power music industry to
        reach out. Midgård, which, at the end of the 1990s, started releasing
        its own records, also had collaborations with other record companies.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Midgård was then run by Per-Anders "Pajen" Johansson. His central role
        meant that he was covered in the major exposé of Nazis in Sweden that
        the newspapers Expressen, Aftonbladet, Dagens Nyheter and Svenska
        Dagbladet published in the fall of 1999. Midgård's store in Hisingen was
        then the site of repeated demonstrations. In 2000, the landlord had
        enough and terminated the contract.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        “Those were stormy years. There were a lot of attacks and fights. It was
        both demanding and stimulating,” Per-Anders Johansson, 53, told
        Expressen. But Midgård managed to live on via mail order and online
        sales. By then, the Swedish white power music scene had become
        internationally known and Midgård had customers in other countries: “We
        sold to Europe: Germany, Poland and England,” Johansson said. However,
        the rise of downloading and eventually streaming music online made it
        increasingly difficult to make ends meet financially. In 2012, he sold
        the business to the company that now runs Midgård.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        “For me, music has always been about buying a record that you could
        touch. I wanted to flip through it, see what the band looked like and
        read the lyrics. Suddenly, music became just something you downloaded. I
        simply became like a dinosaur in a new world. I didn't think it was as
        much fun anymore,” Johansson said, adding that he is happy with how
        Midgård has continued.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        In recent years under its new owners, turnover in the company has
        increased significantly. Over the past ten years, the company has had a
        reported turnover of €1 million (SEK 12 million). In 2023, they reported
        €200,000 (SEK 2.3 million) in turnover, a fivefold increase in reported
        turnover since 2013. The company has become more profitable, not less.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        In various interrogations with the police, representatives of Midgård
        have downplayed their political ties. Tobias Jonsson stated his
        involvement in the company running the Nazi store more as a
        “non-political hobby.” And the owners have constantly emphasized the
        importance of obeying the law in order to continue the business
        undisturbed. But the links between the shop and the organized Nazi
        movement are clear.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Martin Flennfors has declared that he has no interest in being
        interviewed about Midgård's operations and the company's role
        internationally. “I have to thank you so much for the conversation.
        Bye,” he said. When Expressen contacted Martin Engelin, he declined to
        answer questions and referred Expressen to Flennfors.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        The preliminary criminal investigations that began in 2016 and 2022 have
        subsequently been closed.
