# Google-geocoding-API
Data cleaning and geocoding

In this project, I analysed the customer data which was a scraped leak from some online shop. Our research question was 'How many people from Poland were customers of the shop?'

The initial dataset contained columns with the name, surname, street, and city of the customer. I merged the street and city columns, geocoded them, and pulled out names of the countries from the Google API response. Then, I created a clean full_name column to count unique names from Poland.

More details is commented in the code.

The story will soon be published in English at VSquare.org.
