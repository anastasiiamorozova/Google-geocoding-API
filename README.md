# Midgard
- geocoding with google api

In this project, I analysed the customer data which was a scraped leak from an online shop. 

Information on approximately 20,000 purchases on Midgård was put online. The leak, which was spread by the left-wing extremist organization AFA, contains Midgård's customer register and provides insight into just how widespread Midgård's sales are.
The initial dataset contained columns with the name, surname, street, and city of the customer. I geocoded them, and pulled out names of the countries from the Google API response. 



More details is commented in the code.
